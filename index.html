   <p>8/29-9/2</p>
   <p>This week we learned about the Rube Goldberg Machine and sign on and practiced on tinker and created Cads!</b>
   <p>9/5-9/9</p>
   <p>This week we worked on our tinker cad project</p>
   <p>9/12-9/16</p>
   <p> this last few weeks wee been working on our tinker cads and our rube Goldberg machines were close to finishing, today we tested paper boats and mine mostly worked </p>
   <p>9/26-9/30</p>
   <p> This week weve been completing our Rube Goldberg Machine, we have a had many difficulties completing it including cutting shapes that dont match figuring out how to get the second ball to stay then move and our greatest difficultie was triggering the mechanism that would push the 3rd ball into the pully overall the only thing I would change would be more consice disginig and cutting.</h3>
   <p>10/3-10/7</p>
   <p>This week we CADed prostetics for animals I chose I Otter that lost its legs and arms so I made a rover for the Otter to vibe in </p>
   <p>10/10-10/14</p>
   <p>I was out all this week but apparently we CADed bottle rockets</p>
   <P>10/17-10/21</P>
   <p>This week we bult and launched our bottle rockets The tape we were using to put the rocket together was not very strong so we used a glue gun to glue everything together our rocket went far but then looped back and landed at my feet Im pretty proud of it overall</p>
   <p>10/24-10/28</p>
   <p>Enviornmental challenge with filtering water through a soda bottle I drank some</p>
   <p>10/31-11/4</p>
   <p>We made tinker cads for bread boards and figured out how to make compelte circuts</p>
   <p>11/7-11/10</p>
   <p>This week we made running circuts with bread boards</p>
   <P>11/15-11/18</P
   <p>This week we used Arduinos and Breadboards with a coding program on the computer to program the three lights to blink in a certain order the one we spent the most time trying to get was first, last, middle lights order we quickly got them to blink in that order but getting the speed from them to sync perfectly was very difficult and it took many very small changes testing then changing then testing but eventually we got it to sync prefectly were as soon as one would turn off then next would turn on.</p>
   <p>11/29-12/2</p>
   <p>This week we learned about our civil engineering project which was to create a spegetti bridge using only 20 spegooti straws. We came up with many possible designs but our first itaeration ended up being 3 wide and 2 tall spegetti stacked we let it dry over the weekend.</p>
   <p>12/5-12/9</p>
   <p>We Tested our first desgin and it failed misrably so we got to work on our second and it was never completed because as it dried it stuck to the cardboard and then an anyonmus member of the group smashed it and used pieces of our old projects to make a hideous frankenstien bridge which also got smashed. we got the idea to use boba straws to create a mold</p>
   <p>12/12-1216</p>
   <p>We did everything in our power to get that dumb mold to dry but nothing worked so eventually we decided to cut it open and bring it under the the blow dryer to dry it sort of worked but the spegtti was still very soggy and it wouldn't dry but eventually it dried but a small part broke so we had to extend it on friday we also made a bridge just incase the mold bridge didn't fully dry </p>
   <p>12/19-12/20</p>
   <p>everything is fully dry and were ready to start teasting wish us luck :0</p>
