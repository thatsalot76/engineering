   <p>9/26-9/30</p>
   <p> This week weve been completing our Rube Goldberg Machine, we have a had many difficulties completing it including cutting shapes that dont match figuring out how to get the second ball to stay then move and our greatest difficultie was triggering the mechanism that would push the 3rd ball into the pully overall the only thing I would change would be more consice disginig and cutting.</h3>

   <p>This week we bult and launched our bottle rockets The tape we were using to put the rocket together was not very strong so we used a glue gun to glue everything together our rocket went far but then looped back and landed at my feet Im pretty proud of it overall</p>
