   <p>9/30-16/22</p>
   <p> this last few weeks wee been working on our tinker cads and our rube Goldberg machines were close to finishing, today we tested paper boats and mine mostly worked </p>
   <h3> This week weve been completing our Rube Goldberg Machine, we have a had many difficulties completing it including cutting shapes that dont match figuring out how to get the second ball to stay then move and our greatest difficultie was triggering the mechanism that would push the 3rd ball into the pully overall the only thing I would change would be more consice disginig and cutting.</h3>
